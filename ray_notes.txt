# SO: remote decorator registers an invocation of the function and 
# returns a handle. We need to (a) assign the function an ID and return it, (b) pickle the function, (c) store it in a to_be_serviced table, (d) eventually execute it, (e) route the result to a symmetric ``consuming'' hash join with get requests

x_id, y_id = f.remote()
ray.get(x_id)  # 1
ray.get(y_id)  # 2

# get should (a) route a get request to a ``consuming'' hash join with function results, (b) sleep the calling thread as needed, (c) ensure the calling thread wakes up on join success

# Simple version: 
# Futures server:
# - ignore python -- static C++ function invocation and just the dataflows
# - single-node to start
# - ID assignment
# - scheduling (how many functions per tick??)
# - ``consuming'' hash join pattern

ray.get(f.remote())  # {'key1': ['value']}

# Get a list of object IDs.
